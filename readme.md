## Tournament organization

When the game starts, players are randomly distributed into matches of 4 or less participants. When players finish a match (whether it's a race or a whole cup), they can fill the score before moving on to the next match.

When all the matches of a round are over and results are set, the next round is calculated by grouping players of similar level.

When all the rounds are over, the tournament is finished and the final leaderboard is displayed!
